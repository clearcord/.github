## Heya, I'm Alice!

I created Clearcord due to concerns over Discord, one of the leading social media messaging platforms. As Discord's practices raised privacy issues and exhibited concerning actions towards users such as completely ignoring them. And messing with bot delevopers such as forcing them to put paid features on to discord itself. So I have taken it upon myself to develop Clearcord as an alternate platform.

Clearcord is designed to be secure and user-friendly. We ensure that we have no access to your data (if you need to report something you are required to show screenshot evidence). Clearcord operates on the principle of complete privacy for our users. Messages are encrypted so that only you and the intended recipients can view them. This encryption covers all forms of communication within the app, including texts, voice messages, and uploaded files.

Clearcord adheres to data minimization principles, collecting only necessary information to provide our service. The data we collect includes your email address (used solely for a welcome and verification email) and your date of birth (used during sign-up) to ensure you are of age (16+).

In terms of accountability and transparency, Clearcord handles reported content with utmost sensitivity and in compliance with our community guidelines. We empower our users with tools for content moderation and provide clear ways to report inappropriate behavior or content.

At Clearcord, we need user feedback and we want to make sure our community is a part of shaping the platform.
